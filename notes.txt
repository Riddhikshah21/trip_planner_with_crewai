CREW AI:
    
    - Agentic framework allows us to create agents to solve simple or complex task
	- AI agents assume roles, share goals and operate in a cohesive unit like a well-oiled crew
	- Each agent will perform special task and will be a SME.

How CrewAI works:

4 core components:
	1. Agents:
	- Expert in specific domain
	- Properties:
		○ Role - agent's function within the crew.
		○ Goal - individual object agent aims to achieve. 
		○ Backstory - provides context to the agent's role and goal.
		○ Tools - set of capabilities or functions that agent can use to perform task such as searching web. 
		○ Max iter - maximum number of iterations the agents need to perform before its forced to give the best answer.
		○ Max rpm - max number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits.
		○ Verbose - allows you to see what is actually going on during the crew execution.
		○ Allow delegation - allows agent to delegate tasks or question to one another, ensuring task is handled by most suitable agent.
	
    2. Process
	
	- How agents will work together 
	- How task will be assigned
	- Interaction with each other
	- How they will perform task.
	
	3. Tools
	- Agents can use tools to complete tasks.
	- Two types of tools: built in tools(in langchain) and custom tools(search web - we need serper api for this)
	
    4. Task
	- Jobs that agents need to complete. 
	- Requires collaboration between agents  
	- Properties:
		○ Description - clear and concise statement of what the task entails.
		○ Agent - you can specify which agent is responsible for the task otherwise crew will determine who takes it on.
		○ Tools - functions or capabilities that agent can use to perform task such as searching web.
		○ Async execution - if task should be executed asynchronously(tasks can run simultaneously)
